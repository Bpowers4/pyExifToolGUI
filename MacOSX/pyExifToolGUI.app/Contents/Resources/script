# This file is part of pyexiftoolgui.
# pyexiftoolgui is a pySide script program that reads and writes  
# gps tags from/to files. It can use a "reference" image to write the
# gps tags to a multiple set of files that are taken at the same
# location.
# pyexiftoolgui is a graphical frontend for the open source
# command line tool exiftool by Phil Harvey, but it's not
# a complete exiftool gui: not at all.
