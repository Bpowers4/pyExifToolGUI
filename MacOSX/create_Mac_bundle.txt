How to create the mac bundle

Currently I use pyinstaller version 2.0 (www.pyinstaller.org)
Version 2.1 has strange quircks regarding the copying out of the "exe" folder. 
However, that is how Mac OS X works. Binaries go into MacOS, other "things" go
into folders outside the MacOS folder, but 2.1 does not allow this

From within the MacOSX folder:
- open pyexiftoolgui.spec and check whether paths are correct
- run: "<path/to>/pyinstaller-2.0/pyinstaller.py --windowed pyexiftoolgui.spec
- run "./completebundle.sh" to use the install_name_tool to set all links internally.
- Create a folder "pyExifToolGUI-<version>" inside this MacOSX folder
- Copy README.txt, INSTALLATION.txt, Changelog and COPYING inside the "pyExifToolGUI-<version>"
- Copy the pyexiftoolgui.app from the dist folder into the "pyExifToolGUI-<version>".
- Start the Disk Utility program
- Create a dmg ("Create Disk Image from Folder") from the "pyExifToolGUI-<version>" folder.
