Introduction
============

I'm on Linux so this tool is written on Linux and primarily aimed at Linux.
However, it runs fine and functions fine on Mac OS X and Windows as well.
It is currently not part of any Linux distribution and I'm currently lacking 
the skills to write a distutils or exportutils (or good automake/configure) 
script to package it for Ubuntu (or any other Debian based linux), 
or (Open)Suse or Fedora/Redhat.
This also means that it doesn't do any dependency checks for necessary
libraries and so on. 
I simply wrote a "setup" script that takes care of installation and removal. 
Currently that only works on Linux and Mac OS X. For Windows an executable is
available and for Mac OS X a bundle is available.

Run pyexiftoolgui from this folder (No Installation)
====================================================
You can run pyexiftoolgui without installing it: see the paragraph below the
installation instructions. 


Installation on Linux
=====================
Dependencies (Meaning that you need to install them yourself):
- python: part of every linux system, so always available, but >=2.6 required.
- pyside: Install via your distribution's package manager. Otherwise download it from www.pyside.org
- python-pyside (qtcore, qtgui and qtuitools are required): Install via your distribution's package manager. 
  Otherwise download it from www.pyside.org
- ExifTool: Install via your distribution's package manager.

Installation:
- Untar the package to some folder (You obviously did that already if you are reading this).
- Open a terminal and move into the folder where you untarred the pyExifToolGui-x.y.tgz
- Run the setup script from the command line with "sudo ./install_remove.py install".
- pyExifToolGUI will be installed and you should have an icon.
- Start and enjoy.

Installation on Mac OS X
========================
The installation on Mac OS X can be in two ways:
= Download the bundle
= Run the simple version from the tar.gz

= Bundle install
Simple download the dmg containing the bundle and drag the bundle to a suitable place, most likely /Applications.

= Simple bundle version from the tar.gz 
- python: part of every linux system, so always available, but 2.7 required.
  -- (Snow) Leopard: Download python 2.7 from python.org and install. Then run
     Update Shell Profile.command from /Applications/Python 2.7
  -- (Mountain) Lion comes with python 2.7
- pyside: Download it from www.pyside.org. (You can also install it from MacPorts but this will give issues most of the time.)
- pyX.Y-pyside: Install via MacPorts. (XY needs to be 2.7).
- ExifTool: Download the DMG from the ExifTool website (highly preferred) or install via MacPorts.

Installation:
- Untar the package to some folder (You obviously did that already if you are reading this).
- Open a terminal and move into the folder where you untarred the pyExifToolGui-x.y.tgz
- Run the setup script from the command line with "sudo ./install_remove.py install" (no double-quotes).
- The script will install a "bare bones" pyExifToolGUI.app in your Applications folder.
  Note that the pyExifToolGUI.app is NOT a complete self contained application. It needs the mentioned dependencies.
- Start and enjoy.


Installation on Windows
=======================
Download the executable from the website.

   (If python is not in your path, provide the full path to it)


Uninstall / Removal
===================
- Open a terminal
- Move into the folder where you untarred this (You might need to download again if your removed everything).
- run the setup script from the command line with "sudo ./install_remove.py remove" (no double quotes).
