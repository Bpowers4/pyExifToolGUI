Mac OSX has it's unified menubar. This is a main problem for all QT-related (PySide/pyQT)
applications as you will find somewhere in your ui_MainWindow.py (or whatever you called it)
a line menntioning something like:

      MainWindow.setMenuBar(self.menubar)

This line should be removed (or outcommented) on Mac otherwise you don't have a menu.
